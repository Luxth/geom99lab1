    <h1>Road Trip to New York</h1>
    <div class="mytext">
	<p>My road trip to New York contains several places I would like to visit in a day. I would like to go to Times Square, The Empire State Building, 2 Bros Pizza, and Katz’s Delicatessen. Katz’s Delicatessen is the last destination for the day during the week I’m staying in New York because Katz’s Delicatessen is a place where a lot of movies were filmed and also, they are well known for their pastrami and rye bread. However, before going to Katz’s Delicatessen, I want to understand the hype around dollar pizza, which I want to try at 2 Bros pizza. </p>
