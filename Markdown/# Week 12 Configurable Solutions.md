# Week 12 Configurable Solutions

## Field Maps for Data Collection on Trees

- Logged into Field Maps 
- Created a Form that has different fields such as Data and Time, Name of user, FieldID, Height of the Tree, Type of Tree, Native of the tree, Health of the tree, and Flags associated with the tree
- Once finishing the creation of the tree form, the setting were set up to make sure its public for the organization only

## Collection Data for the Form 
-	Used GEOM65 tree data for the 3D map instead of collecting data for the form
-	Collected various data on different trees

## Building a Dashboard with the data collected 

- The data collected from GEOM65 tree data is used to create a 3D map and then it is compared to a 2D map created by a classmate
- The comparison will allow us to speculate on how to submit point data to pre-existing 3D environment
