# Week 13 Configurable Solutions 

## Meeting with Group members

- Discussed different ways to show user submitted point data and displaying it in a Online 3D environment such open-source for the 3D instead of using ArcGIS or using open source collection data app. 
- This way we can cater to both sides of user who prefer ArcGIS products or open source products 
- Talked about how the webpage is being made

## GEOM Data Collection for Tree Points Outside

- Used forum that was created on field maps to collect data around the school
- Took 20 minutes and several days to collect point due to change in weather
- The forum has z values enabled to collect the elevation data for trees

## Pre-processing data collected on ArcGIS Pro and Scene

- Load the feature layer of the data collection performed into ArcGIS Pro scene 
- Symbolize the point data of the feature class and went to properties to enable 3D
- Made the elevation field (Altitude) symbolize the Proportional symbology 
- When picking the 3D object appearance to be used for the elevation value, it made the objects to small so this lead a long time figuring out why that problem was occurring 
- Fixed the 3D object to have the correct elevation value
- Add in 3D OpenStreetMap basemap to show the 3D building with the 3D trees
- Save the Scene and shared onto ArcGIS online
  
## ArcGIS Experience Board
- Used a premade layout
- Add in a menu to switch between the Tree 2D collection data point and 3D scene map
- Publish the map onto ArcGIS Online
