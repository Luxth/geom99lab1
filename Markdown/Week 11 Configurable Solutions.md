##  StoryMaps Markdown Steps

1. Created a StoryMap called YellowStone Park Trail
   
2.  Added a Heading for each slide with a subheading below it and a paragraph text


3. The heading has a parameter of the first heading setting, the subheading has the 3-heading setting, and the paragraph has a font value of 11

4. Each Slide has a picture that is fitted to the image box and not cropped
   
5. Copied the same style of heading, subheading, and paragraph text parameters for each slide
   
6. The last slide has no fitted image parameter, which should have and wasnâ€™t configured
  
7. Created a Web map that shows the campsite, start point, destination point, safe path, trail park throughout the park, and park boundaries
   
8. To create the web map, the layers had to be placed onto a new map layer and go to share tab to be used for an option called share as a web layer to the contents folder of Arcgis Online
   
9.  Once the web map is created, the second last section of the StoryMaps allows you to add the web map to it as Web viewer
   
10. Add the credits at the bottom of the StoryMaps and shared it to the organization that it needs to be in
